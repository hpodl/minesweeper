# Minesweeper

A WIP implementation of the iconic Minesweeper video game.

Currently just a prototype with a fixed, rudimentary GUI.
Its aim is to be lightweight and easily extensible (scoring strategies, alternative textures, rules, board initialization techniques etc.).


## Building
The project uses cmake, so the build process is simply:

`cmake -B <build_directory>`

## Documentation
Can be generated with doxygen, simply run:

`doxygen`

## Dependencies
The only external dependency is FLTK.
